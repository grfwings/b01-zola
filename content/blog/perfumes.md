My favorite perfume shop is [Abdes Salaam Attars Perfumes](https://naturalnicheperfume.com/).
I greatly enjoy every scent of theirs I've tried, but my favorite is their
delightfully boozy Cuba Express.

I also enjoy Le Labo's [Tabac 28](https://www.lelabofragrances.com/about-tabac-28.html),
which has a beautiful but not overpowering blend of rum and tobacco.
I don't own a full bottle of this as it's a seasonal exclusive and quite
expensive, but I hope to acquire one some day.

A few weeks ago at [Ministry of Scent](https://ministryofscent.com/)
(a store I highly recommend for anybody interested in perfume) I found
[Rain on Oak](https://scentsofwood.com/products/rain-on-oak) by Scents of Wood.
I've always liked the idea of woody and aquatic perfumes, but in practice
they're usually filled with artificial, "fresh" detergent scents. Rain on Oak
is none of those. It perfectly delivers on the motif with delicate, earthy musk
that reminds me of hiking on California's Pacific coast.
