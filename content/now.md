*(This is a [now](https://nownownow.com/about) page, and if you have your own site, [you should make one](https://nownownow.com/about), too.)*

Today is November 9, 2025 and I'm writing this from my home in San Francisco as I watch [Worlds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_League_of_Legends_World_Championship).

Techy stuff:
- I'm writing a bunch of [Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) for fun, most of which is in the form of a low-level scripting language/automation tool for Linux, which I hope to publish soon. (If you are are reading this in December or later and this isn't updated, please [bug me about it](mailto:griffinevans@protonmail.com))
- Tinkering with my website (hello!) and drafting more [blog posts](@/blog/_index.md).
